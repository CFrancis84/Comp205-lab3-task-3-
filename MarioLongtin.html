    <h3> Interests </h3>
        <p> I enjoy reading and learning everything related to online business, personal development, psychology, science etc... I like technology a lot, anything from the latest smart televisions, to the latest chipset inside the newest laptops, smart home and Internet of Things (IoT) and of course anything cell phone related as I've been selling them for 4 years now. I enjoy health and fitness however I find myself not finding time, so I need to learn more about time management. I want to graduate this program with extremely high grades too achieve a career in the software development field for a technology company as of now. By the time I'm finished the program I might want to pursue a expert degree by articulating my credits with a University or niching down to Internet Security for example; I'm still unsure about that part. My goals are too gain experience and continue with my own online business endeavours. On my spare time I do enjoy learning specially about software as a system (SaaS), learning how to make apps Android SDK Studio also Xcode and Swift. I made a website using Bluehost and Wordpress just for my own enjoyment as well. </p>
